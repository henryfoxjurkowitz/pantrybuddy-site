          <p>
            Hi! My name is Henry, and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer
            currently in college. I hope you enjoy the app and find some great
            recipes!

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            I designed this app with the original purpose of helping the
            Community Cooks program in my town find new meals to make. But I
            hope anyone that comes across it finds it helpful!

        <h3>Pricing</h3>
        <p>
          It's totally free! I'm only hoping to help people find recipes (a
          problem I'm very familiar with). So download it now - what are you
          waiting for!?
